      "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Russian President Vladimir Putin before a joint news conference following their meeting at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025.\nGavriil Grigorov | Via Reuters\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he will punish Russia and President Vladimir Putin if Moscow doesn't come to the table and agree to peace talks or a ceasefire with Ukraine.\nRussia has shown no signs of intending to do either, instead continuing and increasing its attacks on Ukraine as it looks to consolidate gains on the battlefield.\nAnd still, Trump is holding off on releasing a big bazooka of extra sanctions and economic punishment that could hurt an already weakened Russia.\nThe reason for the standstill is strategic and goes beyond Russia, according to analysts, who warn the longer Trump holds off, the more he's undermining his and the U.S.' position.\n\"The Russian budget is actually under a lot of pressure... so if there were to be any more significant sanctions targeting Russian oil trade from the U.S. — which they've talked about but not done — that would put the budget under greater pressure. It hasn't happened,\" Chris Weafer, the chief executive of Moscow-based Macro-Advisory, told CNBC Monday.\nThere were two significant factors behind Trump's reticence, Weafer said: the president's desire to be seen as a peace-broker, and concerns over pushing Russia deeper into China's orbit.\n\"Trump still thinks he can bring both sides to the table, that he could broker a peace deal, and that he can take credit for moving the conflict towards peace. And bearing in mind that the announcement on the Nobel Peace Prize will come in early October, it's a factor, because we know the character of the of the individual,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\n\"The second reason ... is there is a sense that if Russia is defeated, if Russia is completely isolated by the West, and there's no way back in terms of engaging with the U.S. and Europe, then it has no choice but to go even further all-in with China, and that potentially then would strengthen China's position.\"\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n2:37\n02:37\nWhy isn't Trump tightening the screws on Russia?\nSquawk Box Europe\nBringing Russia and Beijing closer together would mean that the latter had \"almost unlimited\" access to energy resources, industrial materials and to the Arctic, the analyst said, noting that this could effectively block the U.S. from Russian-controlled parts of the Arctic.\nIt would also allow China greater access to Russian military technology, such as stealth submarines, and further opportunities in space exploration.\nOfficials in Washington were concerned about that, Weafer noted, adding, \"they don't want Russia to be essentially a more formal subsidiary of China. They want it to be more in the middle with engagement in the West. I think that's one reason why they're treading carefully for now.\"\nCNBC has contacted the White House for further comment on its strategy toward Moscow and is awaiting a response.\nUkraine, meanwhile, has watched as Trump has let self-imposed deadlines to act against Russia pass, with Kyiv left crestfallen at perceived missed opportunities to pressure Putin into a ceasefire.\n\"Ukrainians had hoped that Trump's August 8 deadline for Putin to accept a cease-fire would provide more constant air defense,\" John Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and the head of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, said in analysis in August.\nYet, they were disappointed when Trump let Putin cross his August 8 deadline to end the fighting without consequences. \"Instead, Trump focused on summitry with Putin, which has yet to yield Russian flexibility,\" Herbst wrote.\n\"Now they are gritting their teeth and, with many of their European partners, waiting for White House officials to realize that Russia is playing them — and to take the strong measures that Trump promised if Russia continued its war on Ukraine,\" he added.\nChina-Russia-India ties deepen\nBeijing and Moscow's leaders were seen to be putting on a display of bonhomie at the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit on Monday. The SCO is being attended by 20 foreign leaders, including Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nAgainst a backdrop of war in Ukraine, Trump's tariffs and continuing oil trade, the major economies of China, Russia and India have deepened their economic and political ties while their respective relations with the West have frayed.\nChinese President\nXi Jinping\non Monday urged his fellow leaders attending the summit to strengthen their cooperation,\nand called on them to reject what he called a \"Cold War mentality.\"\nMeanwhile, Putin told the SCO that his meeting with Trump in August had opened a path to finding a way to resolving the Ukrainian \"crisis,\" as he described the more than three-year war. Yet he thanked Russia's Asian allies for their support throughout the war.\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin (front L) speaks with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (C) and China's President Xi Jinping during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Tianjin on September 1, 2025.\nAlexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty Images\n\"We value the efforts and propositions to solve the Ukrainian crisis of China, India and other strategic partners of ours. The mutual understanding that was reached at a recent Russia-U.S. summit in Alaska heads the same direction, I hope. It paves the way to peace in Ukraine, I hope.\"\nSummits like the SCO were creating a new political and socio-economic ecosystem that could replace the \"outdated\" Euro-Atlantic-centered power model, Putin said.\nThis new system \"would take into account the interests of a maximum number of countries and would be truly balanced,\" meaning \"a system in which one group of countries would not ensure its security at the expense of the others.\"",

Asked by a reporter if the plane had been the intended target of the alleged GPS jamming — which prevents access to the satellite-based navigation system — the spokesperson said, \"I think the question is best asked to the Russians if indeed it is them that have carried it out.\"\nCNBC has contacted the Kremlin for a response to the allegation.

However, an earlier statement to the FT read: \"Since February 2022, there has been a notable increase in [GPS] jamming and recently spoofing occurrences,\" it said. \"These interferences disrupt the accurate reception of [GPS] signals, leading to various operational challenges for aircraft and ground systems.\"\nBulgaria's government on Monday issued a statement, reported by Sky News, saying that \"the satellite signal used for the aircraft's GPS navigation was disrupted.\"\n\"As the aircraft approached Plovdiv Airport, the GPS signal was lost,\" the statement added.",

      "content": "In this article\nNEE\nFollow your favorite stocks\nCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nAn aerial view of the Cedar River and the Duane Arnold Energy Center near Palo, Iowa on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2025.\nNick Rohlman | The Gazette | AP\nThe Duane Arnold nuclear plant northwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa is pressing ahead with plans to restart operations by the end of the decade after shutting down for economic reasons in 2020.\nThe plant is the third – and likely the last – mothballed reactor in the U.S. that is in shape to come back online to support growing electricity demand in the U.S.\nDuane Arnold would follow similar restarts planned for the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan and Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, which plan to resume operations later this year and in 2027, respectively, subject to approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved a request last week from\nNextEra Energy,\nDuane Arnold's owner,\nto let the nuclear plant reconnect to the electric grid. NextEra sees Duane Arnold restarting operations by the fourth quarter of 2028 at the earliest, according to FERC filings.\n\"While a significant amount of work needs to be done before the facility could be restarted, FERC's decision is another positive step in the process,\" Neil Nissan, a NextEra spokesperson, said in a statement to CNBC.\nPower purchase agreement\nWith big technology companies looking to feed more nuclear power on to the grid to fuel the electricity-hungry data centers they are building to train artificial intelligence, Florida-based NextEra is aiming to win a lucrative power purchase agreement to restart Duane Arnold. Three Mile Island, for example,\nis restarting with financial support\nfrom a power agreement with\nMicrosoft\n.\n\"The recommissioning of Duane Arnold has received significant commercial interest from premier American companies,\" Garrett Goldfinger, the NextEra executive in charge of the restart project, told FERC in a late July filing.\nDuane Arnold would bring more than 600 megawatts of electricity back to the grid, equivalent to the electricity needs of more than 400,000 homes.\n\"If we're successful in bringing Duane forward, that obviously creates a hot bed of data center activity around that facility,\" NextEra CEO John Ketchum told investors on the company's July earnings call.\n'Unicorn opportunities'\nDuane Arnold, Palisades and Three Mile Island are three of the 10 U.S. reactors that closed over the past decade as nuclear power strained to compete against cheap natural gas and renewable energy.\nRestarting these plants is the most concrete sign yet that the nuclear industry is coming back after years of financial struggles.\n\"These are unique opportunities because you don't face the new build costs associated with nuclear,\" Ketchum said on NextEra's earnings call. \"These are really unicorn-type opportunities.\"\nNextEra, the largest renewable power developer in the U.S., had previously divided up Duane Arnold's grid connection among multiple solar farms that the company was developing in response to the demand in Iowa for lower cost electricity.\nBut the market last year started to shift back in favor of high-capacity nuclear power as the U.S. saw an unprecedented increase in electricity demand from industry and data centers, NextEra said in its filing to FERC.\nNextEra is now consolidating those solar grid connections back into a single one for Duane Arnold after securing FERC approval. This will \"provide commercial and financial certainty to support the recommissioning effort and expedite the resumption of clean, reliable operations at Duane Arnold,\" Goldfinger told FERC.\nCapital intensive\nNextEra said the restart of Duane Arnold will be a \"highly capital-intensive process.\" It disclosed in its filing to FERC that it plans on spending as much as $100 million in 2025 alone on the project.\nNextEra has placed orders for new transformers to replace the ones that were removed when the plant was shut down, although the transformers face significant supply chain constraints and will take about three years to deliver. The plant's cooling towers, administration building and training center were also dismantled and need to be replaced.\nThe nuclear industry has a long history of projects delays, Goldfinger cautioned, and the Duane Arnold restart could take longer than expected if the transformers, for example, are delivered late.\nWhile there are risks, Duane Arnold represents a financial opportunity for NextEra, the parent company of Florida Power & Light. The stock has barely moved this year despite growing power demand, a sharp reversal from 2024 when shares jumped 18% Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on renewable energy have shaken investor confidence in solar and wind power.\nSolar and wind projects will no longer be eligible for two key tax credits after 2027, which is expected to crimp demand for renewables. Duane Arnold restarting in 2028 could help offset some of the lost earnings from the phase out of the tax credits, Ketchum said on the July earnings call.\n\"You add Duane Arnold to the mix and that's one of many ways that we have to continue to grow the business in the future,\" Ketchum said.",

The number of patients recording such events was also very low, reaching 0.1% for those using Wegovy and 0.4% for those on tirzepatide.\nHowever, the company said the study added to \"growing evidence suggesting that the heart-protective benefits seen with Wegovy are specific to the semaglutide molecule and therefore cannot be extended to other GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1-based treatments.\"\nA world on weight loss drugs: How GLP-1s are reshaping the economy\nGLP-1s, or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, refers to the range of medications used to treat type-2 diabetes and obesity by mimicking hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar.

Nvidia topped the list of top 10 single stocks with largest weekly retail order imbalance over the past week with $867 million net inflows into the name, the Wall Street firm's data showed. Small investors bought the small dip in the AI enabler as the stock fell more than 2% during the past week despite a stellar earnings report. Nvidia beat on earnings and revenue for the quarter and issued guidance for the current period that topped estimates. JPMorgan said retail purchase around midday after Nvidia's earnings reached four times that of the day prior at the same time. Still, retail enthusiasm around Nvidia had faded ahead of Wednesday's big earnings report . Notional monthly flows into Jensen Huang's company, which peaked at around $140 billion in 2024 have since slumped to roughly $50 billion, Goldman Sachs said. It appears that enthusiasm for other AI plays is waning as well.

Their second favorite is Palantir with retail net buying topping $300 million over the past week, JPMorgan said.

If struck down, the duties would impact just roughly 16%.\nThe ruling injects a heavy dose of uncertainty into a central tenet of Trump's economic agenda, which has rattled the global economy since April.\nFor now, the appeals court ruling states the duties on goods from most countries — as high as 50% for a few countries — will stay in effect until\nOct. 14\n, to allow the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nRead more CNBC politics coverage\nRudy Giuliani hospitalized with serious injuries after car accident, spokesman says\nTrump trade adviser blasts tariff ruling: It's 'weaponized partisan injustice'\nTrump tariffs that are voided by — and ones that are safe from — Friday's appeals court ruling\nMost Trump tariffs ruled illegal by appeals court in huge blow to trade policy\nFBI director Patel's girlfriend sues ex-agent for defamation over spy claim\nFate of Fed Gov.

He declared the United States'\ntrade deficit\nwith other nations a national emergency, and invoked IEEPA to impose the steep levies.\nThe appeals court ruled, however, that IEEPA does not give him authority to implement the tariffs, stating that power resides solely with Congress.\n\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said in its\n7-4 ruling\n.\nThe ruling puts Trump's levies, which took effect earlier this month after multiple delays, on shaky ground. Trump imposed the tariffs on more than 60 countries, including a 50% rate on India and Brazil. He also imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most other countries that were not hit with a specified reciprocal tariff rate.\nThe court also deemed Trump's tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico — which the administration claimed were necessary because the countries were not doing enough to curb the alleged trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S. — were illegal.\nTrump has said that he will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" he\nwrote\non social media.\nIf the high court ultimately determines that the tariffs are illegal, there are still other ways for Trump to implement levies, but the scope would likely be much more restricted.\nFor instance, Trump could invoke the\n1974 Trade Act,\nbut that law caps tariffs at 15% and only for 150 days, unless Congress extends them.\nWhich of Trump's levies are spared?\nParts of Trump's agenda remain safe from the court decision.\nMost notably, his sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling.\nEarlier this month, the Trump administration expanded its 50%\nsteel and aluminum tariffs\nto include more than 400 additional product categories, according to the Department of Commerce.\nTrump has relied on these sector-specific tariffs — often referred to as Section 232 tariffs — to bypass court proceedings.\n\"Section 232 tariffs are central to President Trump's tariff strategy,\" Mike Lowell, a partner at law firm Reed Smith,\npreviously told CNBC\n.\n\"They aren't the target of the pending litigation, and they're more likely to survive a legal challenge and continue into the next presidential administration, which is what we saw with the aluminum and steel tariffs originally imposed under the first Trump administration,\" Lowell said.\nThe Trump administration is reportedly planning to expand its sector-specific tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, as a way of skirting the looming legal battles, according to\nThe Wall Street Journal.\nThe tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term, which former President\nJoe Biden\nmaintained, are also likely to remain in place despite the appeals court ruling.\nFinally, the \"de minimis\" exemption was\nofficially eliminated on Friday\n, so imports valued at $800 or less are now subject to tariffs and duties, another blow to small and medium-sized U.S. businesses, and a part of Trump's trade agenda that appears safe from court action.",

      "content": "Brad Lightcap, Chief Operating Officer at OpenAI, attends a conference at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in Cannes, France, June 20, 2023.\nEric Gaillard | Reuters\nSam Altman\nneeded someone to manage the finances. It was 2018, and OpenAI was still a nonprofit research outfit with 40 employees, no consumer product and no clear revenue model. But someone had to oversee the money.\nAltman asked Brad Lightcap, who he'd worked with at startup accelerator Y Combinator, to help him with the search. Lightcap interviewed more than 20 people. Nobody wanted the job. So Lightcap decided to do it himself, stepping into a temporary role as the first business hire inside what was still unmistakably a lab.\n\"We had no idea we were going to make a chatbot that a lot of people were going to talk to,\" Altman said at a dinner with reporters earlier this month in San Francisco that Lightcap also attended. \"That was just not in the conception.\"\nSeven years after joining the nascent startup, Lightcap is operating chief of a $500 billion startup with 3,000 employees. His task is to turn\nOpenAI from a consumer phenomenon, known for creating ChatGPT and sparking the generative AI boom, into a force in the enterprise.\nThe company took a major step in that direction this week, announcing new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India in response to business demand.\nAs it enters new markets, Lightcap doesn't have to worry about building a brand. ChatGPT now boasts more than 700 million weekly active users less than three years into its existence.\nBut selling into the enterprise requires bodies. In the past 18 months, Lightcap has built OpenAI's go-to-market team from around 50 people to more than 700, which includes sales reps and staffers focused on customer success, developer relations and strategic partnerships.\nThe push started in 2023, with GPT-4 and the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise. Businesses could suddenly see that OpenAI's large language models were capable of reliably handling workflow tasks. Clients started coming in from every direction.\n\"It was the first time you cross the chasm of the models being intelligent enough to actually solve problems for businesses,\" Lightcap, 34, said in an interview this week. \"We saw significant demand coming out of that launch.\"\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n3:10\n03:10\nOpenAI accelerates global expansion to win enterprise deals directly from customers\nSquawk on the Street\nModerna\nbegan\nusing ChatGPT Enterprise\nto accelerate drug discovery and summarize vast amounts of research data.\nUber\nbuilt a custom tool that let engineering teams tap OpenAI's models for customer support, driver experience and internal productivity.\nMorgan Stanley\nfirst embedded GPT-4 into workflows on its wealth management team and later extended the integration into\ninvestment banking and trading\n.\n\"I see our responsibility as both building the tools and being, in some ways, the most knowledgeable people in the world on how to deploy them,\" Lightcap said. \"We've taken that seriously from day one.\"\nOpenAI's rollout doesn't rely on traditional sales reps. Instead, its go-to-market strategy leans heavily on engineers who work directly with enterprise partners to ensure the models solve real business problems.\nMicrosoft tension\nWhile playing a central role in global development for one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing businesses, Lightcap also has to manage a sensitive relationship with OpenAI's closest partner and emerging rival,\nMicrosoft\n.\nMicrosoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having poured roughly $13 billion into the company, and its primary cloud provider. OpenAI's models are tightly integrated into Microsoft products like Copilot, and the software giant has used its close ties with OpenAI to offer early access to tools before they're available on other clouds.\nThe deeper OpenAI moves into enterprise sales, the more the two companies collide.\nFor companies already running on Azure, Microsoft's pitch is the seamless integration that comes with adding OpenAI's models to the existing stack. But going directly through OpenAI offers proximity to the teams building the frontier technology.\nIt's not the only market where they're going head-to-head. In Microsoft's\nannual filing\nlast year, the company formally listed OpenAI as a competitor in search and news advertising. The disclosure landed days after OpenAI unveiled a prototype called SearchGPT, underscoring how quickly the two companies' interests were overlapping.\nAnd this week, Microsoft said it's started\npublicly testing\na homegrown AI model called MAI-1-preview that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers.\nLightcap downplayed the rivalry.\n\"The opportunity space is so gigantic that in some sense, it's impossible not to bump into everyone else,\" he said. He emphasized that the key for OpenAI is the quality of its models, their safety and reliability, and how the company works with customers.\nMicrosoft didn't respond to a request for comment.\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella, right, speaks as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman looks on during the OpenAI DevDay event in San Francisco on Nov. 6, 2023.\nJustin Sullivan | Getty Images\nThe two companies are now renegotiating the terms of their partnership, including the enterprise sales split, which delivers 80% of revenue to OpenAI when it owns the customer relationship.\nOther points of tension include OpenAI's work with different cloud providers and the governance system that will shape OpenAI's next stage of growth as it\nraises $40 billion\nand restructures into a commercial entity.\nAs OpenAI expands into new regions, it's tailoring its approach to reflect local demand, preferences and use cases.\nBrazil, now OpenAI's fastest-growing market in Latin America, has more than 50 million monthly ChatGPT users sending about 140 million messages every day. India, with its surging developer base, has become the company's second-biggest user community worldwide. And Australia, home to some of the earliest users of OpenAI's application programming interface (API), is emerging as a hub for enterprise adoption across the Asia-Pacific region.\nThe Sao Paulo office will double as a training center for educators, nonprofits, and small businesses, and as a community hub for Brazil's burgeoning developer base.\n\"There's real energy around AI across Brazil,\" Lightcap said. \"Startups are moving fast and bigger companies are already putting these tools to work. Opening an office here helps us stay close to customers and partners and support that momentum.\"\nOpenAI is hiring locally to tap into active developer ecosystems. In Australia, the Sydney office will serve as a beachhead for enterprise clients across the Pacific. And in Japan, where the company has already launched a joint venture with\nSoftBank\nto roll out enterprise tools\nnationwide\n, the Tokyo team is structured to focus on custom use cases\nlike automation, robotics and AI-driven productivity.\n\"My colleagues in Japan have taught us a lot also about how to actually improve how we go to market, how to improve the way we deliver services to enterprises,\" Lightcap said. \"And so it really becomes this two-way learning process.\"\nIt's not a world Lightcap could have imagined seven years ago, when the fledgling lab he joined was operating out of a three-story wood-frame building in San Francisco's Mission District.\nAt the dinner in San Francisco in August, Lightcap was seated across the table from his boss.\nHe nodded as Altman described what life was like back then and the short workdays out of the limelight.\n\"We really did have a nice life,\" Altman said. \"We were the smartest people in the world doing the most interesting science, on the frontier of discovery, in on this big secret.\"\n—\nCNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.\nWATCH:\nSam Altman says OpenAI pushed a 'much warmer' tone for GPT-5\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n2:34\n02:34\nSam Altman says OpenAI pushed a 'much warmer' tone for GPT-5\nMoney Movers",

There is no crystal ball, but you can review past medical spending.\nSeveral years ago, I started tracking annual out-of-pocket health care costs, including co-payments, prescriptions, medical bills, over-the-counter expenses and more. It's tedious, but I use the number for two open enrollment tasks:\nFinding the right health insurance plan\nDeciding how much to save in my flexible spending account (FSA)\nTotal out-of-pocket expenses, along with detailed receipts, are also useful at tax time to see if I can claim the\nmedical expense deduction\n, which isn't typical. (You must itemize tax breaks to qualify, and\n90% of filers\nuse the standard deduction, according to the latest IRS data. Even then, unreimbursed medical expenses have to exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income.)\nPaying now vs. later\nTypically, health plans offer two choices. You can pay more upfront via higher premiums from each paycheck. Or, you can pay more later with a bigger deductible, which is how much you owe before insurance kicks in.\nBy tracking yearly medical expenses, I can see which option could be more affordable for the coming year.\nIn some cases, the higher deductible is cheaper when you're healthy and rarely use services. Plus, many plans cover preventative care, such as yearly physicals, at no cost, before hitting the deductible.\nThat strategy could change if I expect multiple treatments or a surgery.

I think of the tax savings like a discount.\nThe downside of FSAs is I must spend the balance by the end of the calendar year — or forfeit the funds — with a small carryover allowed into the next year. I track that spending monthly to avoid a surprise balance in December.\nThe average household\nFSA contribution was $2,250\nin 2024, and 77% was expected to be spent by November, according to 2024 data from Numerator, a market research data provider.\ndowell | Moment | Getty Images\nLeverage a health savings account\nBefore joining CNBC, I was a full-time freelance writer for six years, with a high-deductible health insurance plan through\nHealthcare.gov\n.\nPremiums were high, but I could contribute to a\nhealth savings account\n, which works like a long-term emergency fund for medical expenses. Unlike an FSA, the balance rolls over yearly.\nIf you can afford to leave the money untouched, some HSAs let you invest the balance for long-term growth.\nHSAs offer three tax benefits. There's an upfront deduction for deposits, the funds grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free for eligible health care costs.\nIn 2024, two-thirds of companies\noffered investment options\nfor HSA contributions, according to a survey from Plan Sponsor Council of America, which polled more than 500 employers in the summer of 2024.\nBut only 18% of participants were investing their HSA balance, down slightly from the previous year, the survey found.",

Afterwards, she plans to put work on the back burner for a couple months to relax and spend time with family.\n\"It's about building a rhythm into your life of proactive rest instead of waiting until your body demands it,\" she says.\nEvery few weeks, Goetz reevaluates which areas of her life she needs to invest more energy into. She's found success in scheduling her work and rest cycles in a 2:1 cadence.\n\"It can mean two weeks of really pushing at work, and then one week where you kind of take the foot off the pedal and say, OK, I'm going to leave every day at 5 o'clock on the dot, I'm shutting my computer, and I'm going to go see friends,\" she says.\nThose \"bare minimum\" periods allow her to create space for the other important aspects of her life, she says.\n\"If I just let the ambitious side of myself call all the shots, I would work all the time,\" she says. \"But that's not what I want for my full life.\"\nLast Chance: Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?\nSign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course,\nHow to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work\n.

      "content": "In this article\nCOST\nKR\nTGT\nWMT\nFollow your favorite stocks\nCREATE FREE ACCOUNT\nJC Milhet | AFP | Getty Images\nOn Monday, under new policy included in President Trump's tax law, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that have provided low-income Americans with more purchasing power in the grocery store begin to go into effect. According to one estimate, it is\n\"the largest cut to SNAP in history,\"\na federal program which in one form or another\ndates back to the New Deal era\nand currently provides basic food assistance to more than 40 million people.\nGrocers large and small are bracing for the impact of changes to the SNAP program. A CBO analysis released this month estimates that\n2.4 million fewer Americans\n, including families with children, are forecast to receive food stamps benefits in an average month. Other estimates show\nfamilies across the U.S. could lose\nanywhere from $72 to $231 per month in support.\nWhile low-income Americans will have more difficulty qualifying for the benefits, many experts predict that some of the largest grocers, despite having many SNAP recipients among their ranks of customers, may actually benefit.\nAccording to consumer data company Numerator's verified purchase data for SNAP users,\nWalmart\nleads in SNAP shopper spend with 24 percent, followed by\nKroger\n(8%),\nCostco\n(6%),\nAmazon\n(5%), and Sam's Club (4%).\n\"On the surface one would think less SNAP would be a negative, but the way these things have played out in the past and the way I think it will play out this time is that discount grocers that focus on value, these kinds of economic headwinds for lower-income customers end up being a positive,\" said Michael Baker, analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.\nBaker cited Walmart as one of the retailers that will likely see a positive impact from the SNAP changes.\n\"Consumers have to find other ways to save money, they still need groceries. I can envision a little bit of a negative impact on the size of the purchase or units per transaction, but that tends to get offset by increased traffic,\" Baker said.\nHe thinks customers spending SNAP dollars at\nTarget\nor Costco are going to trade down to stretch their dollars. Other retailers, such as\nB.J. Wholesale\n, may benefit because it is positioning itself as a value-based destination for weekly club store grocery shopping, according to Baker.\nScott Moses, group head of grocery, restaurants and pharmacy group at Solomon Partners, also expects Walmart to come out a winner in the SNAP changes.\n\"As the world's largest grocer – by a very wide margin – Walmart can use its scale and extremely low cost of debt to capitalize on SNAP cuts – as it has done with food inflation – offering better prices than its smaller peers can afford to match and strengthening its customer value proposition,\" Moses said.\nThe biggest impact to grocers, according to Baker, will be felt around the edges, and it is at the level of independent stores that the most pain is expected. Independent grocery store operators are on edge.\nStephanie Johnson, group vice president of government relations at the National Grocers Association, which represents 20,000 independent and small chain grocery stores across the country, says that the changes will hit grocery stores in two waves.\nJohnson says work requirements — for example, when adults do not report working 20-hours per week or complete paperwork to qualify for an exemption, they will only be eligible for SNAP benefits for three months every three years — are going into effect now as states implement changes.\n\"Those people will fall off immediately as states implement changes,\" Johnson said, adding that these changes are about half the impact of the SNAP changes. \"And the impact will be different depending on the neighborhood. There are a lot of unknowns,\" she added.\nNGA member make up one-third of the grocery industry and $250 billion in sales a year, but exposure to SNAP varies widely, with some grocers having less than 1 percent of their sales as SNAP while others push 70 percent.\n\"Our members have between a 1–2 percent net profit margin, that is a big change. Because of those margins, our members are not getting rich off of SNAP,\" she said.\nThe trade group will be engaging with Congress, citing data such as the fact that SNAP makes up about 12 percent of grocery sales in the U.S., and 6 to 10 percent of those sales could be impacted by the loss of benefits, with ripple effects on jobs in the sector, but she said that it is unlikely any changes will be rolled back in the current Congress.\nKatina Holliday, owner of Freshly's Market in Aberdeen, Mississippi, opened the grocery as a way to combat a food desert. She is in the process of opening a second Freshly's in another nearby community, which means the SNAP changes are coming at a bad time. \"Our sales have totally decreased the past couple of months to the lowest I have seen,\" Holliday said.\nShe says Freshly's has seen a 35 to 45 percent decrease in business, forcing her to cut hours, consolidate management positions, and put a hiring freeze in place. \"Walmart will benefit totally because they are able to get volume at a lower price. We don't take in a large volume and we pay a higher price already,\" Holliday added. \"There isn't loyalty like there used to be,\" she added.\nWalmart, and most major grocery store chains, declined to comment. But Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle, which is the No. 1 grocery store in its market, with stores also in Columbus and Cleveland, Ohio, said it is working on limiting the impact to shoppers from the SNAP changes.\n\"As retailers look toward the next 12 to 24 months, there is a recognition that changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) may impact grocery budgets for some families,\" said a Giant Eagle spokesman. He noted that the benefit cuts come during a period of time when consumers are prioritizing value more than ever. Over the past 12 months, he noted, industry grocery prices have been influenced by compounding factors including recent and existing tariff implementation, fluctuations in transportation costs, and product availability challenges driven by a variety of factors.\nIn addition to weekly sales available in circulars, discounts in the Giant Eagle mobile app, and grocery and fuel rewards through a loyalty program, the spokesman said Giant Eagle will be working with suppliers to explore all opportunities to maintain and reduce costs. \"We feel this is the best way we can help customers save on their groceries, regardless of the individual budget challenges they may be facing,\" he said.\nThe cost to Americans will ultimately extend beyond grocery store dollars, according to Michael Goldberg, associate professor at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, who says there is a larger question underlying the SNAP reform debate that gets obscured — the trading down of nutritional value.\nGoldberg says SNAP has served as a sort of partnership between the federal government and grocers that has provided those at the lower end of the income scale access to food they might not have otherwise been able to purchase.\n\"The dollar goes farther at Walmart than at the farmers market,\" Goldberg said.\nThat means SNAP customers who once might have spent their benefits for costlier, but healthier, farmers market produce will now more likely find themselves picking through the aisles of Walmart. These societal costs, he says, are harder to calculate.\n\"We pay for this one way or another if people are not eating healthy,\" Goldberg said.\nwatch now\nVIDEO\n3:12\n03:12\nAmazon's grocery could be a trojan horse to move revenue higher, says Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaney\nThe Exchange",

While the drink costs the same as last year, it has had six price hikes since 2012 — and has outpaced inflation over the past decade.\nThe vodka-based beverage has become synonymous with the New York City-based event. It's adorned with honeydew melon chunks that resemble tennis balls and is served in a souvenir glass.\nDespite the high cost, the U.S. Open sold\nmore than 550,000\nof the cocktail last year, bringing in almost $13 million in revenue, according to NBC New York.\nAs tennis fans descend on New York for the two-week-long event, CNBC calculated how the Honey Deuce's price change has fared compared with broader inflation.\nHoney Deuce enthusiasts are shelling out around 53% more than they did in 2015, when the beverage cost $15, according to\nSportico's\nprice tracker.\nThat's higher than broader inflation as tracked in the consumer price index, or CPI.

      "content": "Now may be the time to snap up shares of Deckers Outdoors following a painful year-to-date selloff, according to UBS. In a Friday note, the bank reiterated its buy rating on the footwear manufacturer, whose portfolio of brands includes Ugg, Hoka and Teva. Analyst Jay Sole's 12-month price target of $158 implies that the stock could rally nearly 32% from Friday's close of $119.63. Shares of Deckers have stumbled 41% this year. DECK YTD mountain DECK YTD chart Sole said the stock's pullback may present an attractive entry point for investors. \"We see a very good opportunity to buy shares in a growth company currently significantly undervalued by the market,\" he wrote. One reason for Sole's increased price target was a higher probability that Deckers' earnings will grow in the next few years. \"We currently model FY28 EPS of $7.90 but now see a greater probability our $10.00 upside case plays out,\" Sole said. \"DECK has multiple growth drivers which when looked at in total create a more compelling outlook than we previously realized.\" Sole specifically pointed to strong sales growth potential for Deckers' Hoka sneakers brand. He said there are emerging opportunities to expand in new verticals such as lifestyle, apparel, training and recovery, as well as \"major\" geographic expansion opportunities in Asia and Europe. Momentum also exists for the company to grow its global store count, he said. Meanwhile, Sole also emphasized Decker's recent increases in its marketing investments as a percentage of sales to more than 10%. U.S. brand momentum for Hoka remains strong, and any tariff-related risks doesn't dull Sole's \"enthusiasm for the big picture story,\" he said. The analyst added that Hoka's \"max cushioning\" shoe trend is one that likely has legs to stay relevant with consumers over the long run.",

It ranked 29 out of 48 global pension systems assessed.\n\"It means that the system is solid, designed well, but there is a significant risk,\" said Mahoney. \"And if we don't clear that risk up, the system could be in some jeopardy.\"\nHow the U.S. could 'significantly' improve its C+ grade\nHalfpoint Images | Moment | Getty Images\nCountries\naround the world are\nraising their retirement ages\n, as well as requiring\nmandatory contributions\ninto personal retirement savings, according to research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Experts suggest this can help address modern problems such as people living longer and fewer workers paying into the system.\n\"For the U.S. system, the thing that could change that grade significantly, the most important is actually coverage,\" Mahoney said. \"Our 401(k) plans are voluntary.\"\nThe Netherlands is frequently given a top score in the index. Mahoney says one of the key features that makes the Dutch system stand out is mandatory contributions.\nThere are two broad models for retirement plans, and they function very differently:\nA\ndefined contribution plan\n, such as a 401(k) or\nindividual retirement account\n, works like a bucket. Workers decide how much to put in, how to invest it and, in some cases, employers add to the bucket as well. The balance at retirement depends on contributions and investment returns, leaving the final outcome uncertain. In the United States, participation in these plans is voluntary, and workers typically must choose to opt in.\nA\ndefined benefit plan\nresembles a faucet. Programs like\nSocial Security\nor employer-sponsored pensions in the U.S. promise a steady stream of income in retirement, often based on salary and years of service. It's frequently required that the worker fund the program, either through taxes or as grounds for employment. Employers or governments manage the funding and investment risk, while retirees receive predictable monthly payments, typically for life.\nWhat countries like the Netherlands and Australia do differently\nfrom\nthe U.S. is require workers to pay into defined contribution plans.\n\"In the Netherlands ... there's a mandatory contribution made,\" Mahoney said. \"You can't opt out of it either as an employer or as an employee. So getting money [into defined contribution accounts] in the U.S. is a real challenge because it is a voluntary system. If we're going to stay voluntary, then getting it easier to launch a plan and join a plan is the critical thing for [the U.S.] to focus on.\"\nWatch the\nvideo\nabove to learn more about how the U.S. retirement system stacks up against those of countries like the Netherlands and Australia.",
