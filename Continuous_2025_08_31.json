      "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 12:00:01 GMT",
      "content": "Sam Altmanneeded someone to manage the finances. It was 2018, and OpenAI was still a nonprofit research outfit with 40 employees, no consumer product and no clear revenue model. But someone had to oversee the money. Altman asked Brad Lightcap, who he'd worked with at startup accelerator Y Combinator, to help him with the search. Lightcap interviewed more than 20 people. Nobody wanted the job. So Lightcap decided to do it himself, stepping into a temporary role as the first business hire inside what was still unmistakably a lab. \"We had no idea we were going to make a chatbot that a lot of people were going to talk to,\" Altman said at a dinner with reporters earlier this month in San Francisco that Lightcap also attended. \"That was just not in the conception.\" Seven years after joining the nascent startup, Lightcap is operating chief of a $500 billion startup with 3,000 employees. His task is to turnOpenAI from a consumer phenomenon, known for creating ChatGPT and sparking the generative AI boom, into a force in the enterprise. The company took a major step in that direction this week, announcing new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India in response to business demand. As it enters new markets, Lightcap doesn't have to worry about building a brand. ChatGPT now boasts more than 700 million weekly active users less than three years into its existence. But selling into the enterprise requires bodies. In the past 18 months, Lightcap has built OpenAI's go-to-market team from around 50 people to more than 700, which includes sales reps and staffers focused on customer success, developer relations and strategic partnerships. The push started in 2023, with GPT-4 and the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise. Businesses could suddenly see that OpenAI's large language models were capable of reliably handling workflow tasks. Clients started coming in from every direction. \"It was the first time you cross the chasm of the models being intelligent enough to actually solve problems for businesses,\" Lightcap, 34, said in an interview this week. \"We saw significant demand coming out of that launch.\" Modernabeganusing ChatGPT Enterpriseto accelerate drug discovery and summarize vast amounts of research data.Uberbuilt a custom tool that let engineering teams tap OpenAI's models for customer support, driver experience and internal productivity.Morgan Stanleyfirst embedded GPT-4 into workflows on its wealth management team and later extended the integration intoinvestment banking and trading. \"I see our responsibility as both building the tools and being, in some ways, the most knowledgeable people in the world on how to deploy them,\" Lightcap said. \"We've taken that seriously from day one.\" OpenAI's rollout doesn't rely on traditional sales reps. Instead, its go-to-market strategy leans heavily on engineers who work directly with enterprise partners to ensure the models solve real business problems. While playing a central role in global development for one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing businesses, Lightcap also has to manage a sensitive relationship with OpenAI's closest partner and emerging rival,Microsoft. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having poured roughly $13 billion into the company, and its primary cloud provider. OpenAI's models are tightly integrated into Microsoft products like Copilot, and the software giant has used its close ties with OpenAI to offer early access to tools before they're available on other clouds. The deeper OpenAI moves into enterprise sales, the more the two companies collide. For companies already running on Azure, Microsoft's pitch is the seamless integration that comes with adding OpenAI's models to the existing stack. But going directly through OpenAI offers proximity to the teams building the frontier technology. It's not the only market where they're going head-to-head. In Microsoft'sannual filinglast year, the company formally listed OpenAI as a competitor in search and news advertising. The disclosure landed days after OpenAI unveiled a prototype called SearchGPT, underscoring how quickly the two companies' interests were overlapping. And this week, Microsoft said it's startedpublicly testinga homegrown AI model called MAI-1-preview that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. Lightcap downplayed the rivalry. \"The opportunity space is so gigantic that in some sense, it's impossible not to bump into everyone else,\" he said. He emphasized that the key for OpenAI is the quality of its models, their safety and reliability, and how the company works with customers. Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment. The two companies are now renegotiating the terms of their partnership, including the enterprise sales split, which delivers 80% of revenue to OpenAI when it owns the customer relationship. Other points of tension include OpenAI's work with different cloud providers and the governance system that will shape OpenAI's next stage of growth as itrai... [truncated]",

      "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/30/trump-trade-tariffs-appeals.html",
      "summary": "If the Supreme Court upholds the ruling, President Donald Trump would lose some, but not all, of his broad tariff powers.",
      "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 19:25:45 GMT",
      "content": "PresidentDonald Trump'saggressive trade agenda hit a significant snag this week when a federal appeals court ruled that most of his \"reciprocal tariffs\" are illegal. TheU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal CircuitheldFridaythat Trump overstepped his presidential authority when he imposed levies on virtually every country in the world as part of his April 2 \"liberation day\" announcement. Before court action, Trump's tariffs were set to affect roughly 69% of U.S. goods imports,according to the Tax Foundation. If struck down, the duties would impact just roughly 16%. The ruling injects a heavy dose of uncertainty into a central tenet of Trump's economic agenda, which has rattled the global economy since April. For now, the appeals court ruling states the duties on goods from most countries ‚Äî as high as 50% for a few countries ‚Äî will stay in effect untilOct. 14, to allow the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeals court decision affects the \"reciprocal tariffs\" Trump announced on April 2, as well as levies he had previously imposed on Mexico, Canada and China. Trump cited the1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Actto justify his sweeping tariffs. He declared the United States'trade deficitwith other nations a national emergency, and invoked IEEPA to impose the steep levies. The appeals court ruled, however, that IEEPA does not give him authority to implement the tariffs, stating that power resides solely with Congress. \"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the court said in its7-4 ruling. The ruling puts Trump's levies, which took effect earlier this month after multiple delays, on shaky ground. Trump imposed the tariffs on more than 60 countries, including a 50% rate on India and Brazil. He also imposed a 10% baseline tariff on most other countries that were not hit with a specified reciprocal tariff rate. The court also deemed Trump's tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico ‚Äî which the administration claimed were necessary because the countries were not doing enough to curb the alleged trafficking of fentanyl into the U.S. ‚Äî were illegal. Trump has said that he will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. \"If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\" hewroteon social media. If the high court ultimately determines that the tariffs are illegal, there are still other ways for Trump to implement levies, but the scope would likely be much more restricted. For instance, Trump could invoke the1974 Trade Act,but that law caps tariffs at 15% and only for 150 days, unless Congress extends them. Parts of Trump's agenda remain safe from the court decision. Most notably, his sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling. Earlier this month, the Trump administration expanded its 50%steel and aluminum tariffsto include more than 400 additional product categories, according to the Department of Commerce. Trump has relied on these sector-specific tariffs ‚Äî often referred to as Section 232 tariffs ‚Äî to bypass court proceedings. \"Section 232 tariffs are central to President Trump's tariff strategy,\" Mike Lowell, a partner at law firm Reed Smith,previously told CNBC. \"They aren't the target of the pending litigation, and they're more likely to survive a legal challenge and continue into the next presidential administration, which is what we saw with the aluminum and steel tariffs originally imposed under the first Trump administration,\" Lowell said. The Trump administration is reportedly planning to expand its sector-specific tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, as a way of skirting the looming legal battles, according toThe Wall Street Journal. The tariffs that Trump imposed on China during his first term, which former PresidentJoe Bidenmaintained, are also likely to remain in place despite the appeals court ruling. Finally, the \"de minimis\" exemption wasofficially eliminated on Friday, so imports valued at $800 or less are now subject to tariffs and duties, another blow to small and medium-sized U.S. businesses, and a part of Trump's trade agenda that appears safe from court action.",

      "summary": "Since taking office in January, Trump has placed the Fed directly in the crosshairs of executive power.",
      "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 12:11:48 GMT",
      "content": "President Donald Trump's effort to sack Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is about more than firing someone: It's a maneuver that, if successful, would mark a seismic shift for an institution that for ages had been considered above politics. Since taking office in January, Trump has placed the Fed directly in the crosshairs of executive power. He has berated central bankers for not lowering rates, threatened to remove ChairJerome Powell, and now has taken the unprecedented step of actually attempting to unseat Cook. From the president's perspective, he's looking to reform what has been an unpopular institution, often blamed for therunaway inflationthat hit the U.S. following the Covid pandemic. Trump sees lower interest rates as a pathway to manage the swelling federal debt while boosting a housing market that has been a counterweight to an otherwisegrowing economy. However, legal scholars as well as financial market experts and present and former Fed officials say Trump's moves not only threaten to make the Fed more political but also would undermine key pillars of the American financial system. \"We are on a road that is going to lead to the erosion of central bank independence,\" said Kathryn Judge, a professor at Columbia Law School. \"It would be incredibly costly for the long-term health of the economy for the Fed to lose the credibility that it has spent decades trying to build.\" Independence in the Fed's case is a term used to describe its freedom from outside political influence to determine monetary policy that is best for the U.S. economy. This is particularly the case if those decisions are unpopular, such as when the Federal Open Market Committee raises interest rates to bring down inflation. But there's more at stake than simply the level of the three rates the Fed controls. Should Trump get a majority of members on the board of governors to vote the way he wants ‚Äî and the evidence right now, to be sure, is scant that he can ever achieve such a goal ‚Äî it would give him access to key levers that control the economy as well as the nation's financial infrastructure. The seven-member Board of Governors, for instance, has regulatory and enforcement power over banks. Moreover, while the 12-member FOMC sets the key overnight funds interest rate, the governors alone establish the discount rate, used to find the present value of money, and the interest on reserve balances, which pays banks for storing their money at the Fed and also serves as a kind of guardrail for the funds rate. Finally, the board has control over the reappointments of the 12 regional bank presidents, with a slew of names coming up in 2026. Embedded within those responsibilities is the Fed's role in ensuring the integrity of the Treasury system and preserving a stable dollar. In other words, this is about more than just getting a rate cut in September. \"The most serious danger, I think, to people's being able to have confidence in the Fed board is what Trump is himself doing,\" said Robert Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School. \"Because if Trump succeeds with this, then it suggests the Fed board is nothing but a rubber stamp. It just basically tells us that any nutjob who happens to get into the White House will be setting monetary policy henceforth.\" The effect, Hockett added, is that \"we can have the same kind of hyperinflations in the future that banana republics in Latin America have classically had when their dictators have set monetary policy, or that Turkey has experienced in recent years because its dictator has set monetary policy.\" For the administration's part, Trump's lieutenants largely say they believe in Fed independence but see the central bank as institution run amok that needs reigning in. However, the president has conceded he will litmus testnominees for board vacancieson their willingness to lower rates, and he in the past has advocated getting a say in the Fed's rate decisions among other measures that might be considered intrusions into the central bank's space. \"I don't think it's an undermining of Fed independence. I just think it's the fact the system needs a wholesale reevaluation and President Trump just does things unconventionally,\" said Joseph LaVorgna, a senior economist during the first Trump term and now counselor to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"There definitely has been mission creep on behalf of the Fed getting into climate change and issues of diversity and inclusion and things that certainly go well beyond their mandate.\" In fact, the notion that the Fed needs an overhaul has support on Wall Street. Mohamed El-Erian, the former Pimco executive and now chief economic advisor at Allianz, recently advocated that Powell step down as chair to avoid just the kind of battle over independence that is happening now. Moreover, he said the Fed's own policy mistakes helped precipitate the current battle. \"This is the exact world that I was worried about,\" El-Erian said Friday on CNBC. \"The Fed is vu...

      "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 19:45:03 GMT",
      "content": "PresidentDonald Trump'strade adviserPeter Navarrosaid Sunday that \"it will be the end of the United States\" if the president's sweeping tariffs are ultimately blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court. Navarro's comments echoed Trump's own rhetoric as the president sharply criticized last week's7-4 appeals court decision, which ruled that most of Trump's tariffs are illegal, placing a central tenet of the administration's economic agenda on shaky ground. The final ruling on the matter is likely to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. As the battle over Trump's tariffs intensifies, the president's advisers are casting the ultimate outcome as pivotal to the future of the country. \"This was weaponized partisan injustice at its worst,\" Navarro said onFox's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"If we lose the case, President Trump is right. It will be the end of the United States,\" he said. Navarro also said that he feels \"very optimistic\" about the administration's arguments to the Supreme Court. \"A very good dissent provides a road map for the Supreme Court. We feel very optimistic,\" Navarro said. TheU.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal CircuitheldFridaythat Trump overstepped his presidential authority when he invoked the1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Actto justify the sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs against virtually every country in the world. The appeals court allowed Trump's tariffs to stay in effect until Oct. 14, giving the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. \"If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,\" Trump wrote on hisTruth Social after the ruling. He added that \"with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use [tariffs] to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!\" Trump later on Sunday reiterated his dire warning about the tariffs. \"Without Tariffs, and all of the TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS we have already taken in, our Country would be completely destroyed, and our military power would be instantly obliterated,\" hewroteon Truth Social. Trump's claims that his tariffs have already generated \"trillions of dollars\" for U.S. coffers are false. So far this fiscal year, the U.S. has generated $142 billion in tariff revenue, according to the most recent Treasury Departmentdata. And much of that amount was derived from customs duties received before Trump's tariff\"liberation day\"in April. Most of the levies announced as part of that roll-out didn't take effect until early August. TheTax Policy Center estimatesthat Trump's tariffs will raise a total of about $2.9 trillion for fiscal years 2026 through 2035 ‚Äî if Trump's tariffs are ultimately found to be legal. Still, Trump's tariffs are not paid for by foreign governments or companies. American consumerstypically bear the bruntof the tariffs, as U.S. businesses often have to raise prices to respond to higher costs. The Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump's tariffs would impose \"a burden of about $2,700 in 2026 for the average taxpayer.\" Without court action, the tariffs were set to affect roughly 69% of U.S. goods imports,according to the Tax Foundation, but if blocked, the duties would impact just roughly 16%. Parts of Trump's agenda remain safe from Friday's court decision. Most notably, hissector-specific levieson steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling.",

      "summary": "GOP lawmakers returning to Capitol Hill after the break will have to find a way to work with Democrats ‚Äî or around them ‚Äî as a government shutdown looms.",
      "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:01:19 GMT",
      "content": "Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed PresidentDonald Trump's\"big beautiful bill\" of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats ‚Äî or around them ‚Äî as a government shutdown looms. The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia's trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian PresidentVladimir Putinon Ukraine. In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former PresidentJoe Bidenwhile Republican Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break: The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it's so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that. Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. The decision by Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party. The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid. Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. \"Trump is rooting for a shutdown,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday. Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August ‚Äî fighting over Trump's nominees. Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration's positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could \"GO TO HELL!\" Republicans now say they're ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work. Republican Sen.Lindsey Grahamof South Carolina, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia's invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won't move without him. Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinand Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyylast month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine. \"If we don't have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,\" Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest. Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez's lawyers said she refused \"to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.\" Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue. The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force the Trump administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein.

      "summary": "Modi and Xi Jinping discussed ways to improve trade ties amid global tariff uncertainty at a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,",
      "published": "Sun, 31 Aug 2025 21:40:51 GMT",
      "content": "India and China are development partners, not rivals, Prime MinisterNarendra Modiand Chinese PresidentXi Jinpingagreed on Sunday, as they discussed ways to improve trade ties amid global tariff uncertainty. Modi is in China for the first time in seven years to attend a two-day meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation regional security bloc, along with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinand leaders from Iran, Pakistan and four Central Asian states in a show of Global South solidarity. Analysts say Xi and Modi are seeking to align against pressure from the West, days after U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpimposed a punitive total of 50% tariff on Indian goods, partly in response to New Delhi's purchase of Russian oil. Trump's moves hurt decades of carefully cultivated U.S. ties with New Delhi, which Washington had hoped would act as a regional counterweight to Beijing. Modi told Xi his country was committed to improving ties with China and discussed reducing India's burgeoning bilateral trade deficit of nearly $99.2 billion, while emphasizing the need to maintain peace and stability at their disputed border after a clash in 2020 triggered a five-year military standoff. \"We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,\" Modi said during the meeting on the sidelines of the summit, according to a video posted on his official X account. He said an atmosphere of \"peace and stability\" has been created on their disputed Himalayan border and that cooperation between the two nations was linked to the interests of 2.8 billion people of the world's two most populous countries. The nuclear-armed Asian neighbors share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. Xi said that China and India are each other's development opportunities rather than threats, Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. \"We must ... not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,\" Xinhua reported Xi as saying. China-India ties could be \"stable and far-reaching\" if both sides focus on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, Xi added. Ties between the nations were ruptured by the 2020 clash, in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat, following which the Himalayan border was heavily militarized by both sides. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters later in the day in that the border situation had evolved over the course of last year, following a patrolling agreement in October. \"The situation at the border is moving towards normalization,\" he said. To a question on the U.S. tariffs, he said that Modi and Xi discussed the international \"economic situation\" and the challenges it created. \"They tried to ... see how to leverage that for building greater understanding between themselves and how to ... take forward the economic and commercial relationship between India and China,\" he said. The leaders also discussed expanding common ground on bilateral, regional, and global issues, and challenges like terrorism and fair trade in multilateral platforms, a statement from the Indian foreign ministry said. Both leaders had a breakthrough meeting in Russia last year after reaching a border patrol agreement, setting off a tentative thaw in ties that has accelerated in recent weeks as New Delhi seeks to hedge against renewed tariff threats from Washington. Direct flights between both nations, which have been suspended since 2020, are being resumed, Modi added, without providing a timeframe. China had agreed to lift export curbs on rare earths, fertilizers and tunnel boring machines this month during a key visit to India by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. China opposes Washington's steep tariffs on India and will \"firmly stand with India,\" Chinese Ambassador to India Xu Feihong said this month. In recent months, China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Hindu and Buddhist sites in Tibet, and both countries have lifted reciprocal tourist visa restrictions. \"I see the meeting as a step in the direction of incremental improvement. The readouts indicate a lot of mixed political signalling ... But there's also a sense of the need to stabilise the relationship in the context of broader geopolitical currents,\" said Manoj Kewalramani, a Sino-Indian relations expert at the Takshashila Institution think tank in Bengaluru. Other long-term irritants remain in the relationship, too. China is India's largest bilateral trade partner, but the long-running trade deficit ‚Äî a persistent source of frustration for Indian officials ‚Äî reached a record $99.2 billion this year. Meanwhile, a planned Chinese mega-dam in Tibet has sparked fears of mass water diversion that could reduce water flows on the major Brahmaputra River by up to 85% in the dry season, according to Indian government estimates. India also hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader whom Beijing views as a dangerous separat... [truncated]",

      "published": "Sat, 30 Aug 2025 16:36:05 GMT",
      "content": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told staff it expects them to return to offices by Sept. 15, roughly five weeks aftera gunman's deadly attackon the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, CNBC has learned. \"Your safety remains our top priority. We are taking necessary steps to restore our workplace and will return to regular on-site operations no later than Monday, September 15,\" Lynda Chapman, the agency'snew chief operating officer, said in an email sent Thursday that was viewed by CNBC. Chapman said all staff will be expected to return to their offices by that date, according to the email. For employees whose workspaces remain impacted by the shooting ‚Äî including physical damage from the gunman's attack ‚Äî the CDC will provide alternative spaces on its campus, Chapman wrote in the email. She said the agency has made \"significant progress\" on repairs at the CDC Roybal Campus in Atlanta. CDC leadership and a \"Response and Recovery Management\" team are working to address staff concerns and ensure a safe environment as the agency transitions back to in-office work, Chapman added. CDC staff had been instructed to work remotely following the Aug. 8 shooting, with options to return to the office in the weeks that followed, according to two people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution for speaking to the media. The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The internal announcement comes at a tumultuous time for the CDC and its workforce. The shooting didn't result in injuries among CDC staff but shell-shocked a workforce that was already reeling from sweeping changes under HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including staff cuts and heated controversy over his efforts to change CDC immunization policies and fire the agency's panel of vaccine advisors. The return-to-office guidance also comes as the CDC grapples with a leadership upheaval: The White House earlier this week said President Donald Trump hadfired the agency's director, Susan Monarez. Four other top officials resigned, some of them citing the politicization of the agency and a threat to public health. Authorities identified the gunman behind the shooting at CDC headquarters as Patrick Joseph White and said they recovered five guns and more than 500 shell casings from the scene. During the attack, agency employees were forced to barricade themselves in offices. White fatally shot a responding police officer, 33-year-old David Rose, and then killed himself. White hadblamedthe Covid-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal. Before her firing, Monarez appeared to directly blame the role of misinformation in the shooting, according to an email sent to staff on Aug. 12 that was viewed by CNBC. In the note, Monarez said, \"the dangers of misinformation and its promulgation has now led to deadly consequences. I will work to restore trust in public health to those who have lost it- through science, evidence, and clarity of purpose. I will need your help.\"",

      "content": "September in markets is a bit like a Monday morning; no one looks forward to it, and it usually lives up to its reputation. August gave investors plenty to cheer about, but history says September tends to be theworst month of the yearfor stocks. TheS&P 500hit a fresh record high at theend of August, topping 6,500, while theDow Jonesalso touched new peaks. Across the Atlantic, theStoxx Europe 600logged its first two-month winning streak since February. But the specter of September looms large. Traditionally, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all post their worst month of the year in September, according toDow Jones data. From a sector perspective, it's a mixed picture, particularly in Europe. Two-thirds of the way through the third quarter ‚Äî driven by corporate earnings across the continent and continued global macro uncertainty ‚Äî there are clear winners and losers. The biggest gainer? Europe's banking sector. Shares hit theirhighest levelsince the 2008 financial crisis at the start of August, as positive earnings and more talk of deals in the space continued to drive growth. Germany'sCommerzbankhas led the charge higher, with shares adding to their already impressive performance in the first half, up over 100% year to date. On the downside, media stocks have been hit hard over the past two months ‚Äî a decline of over 8% ‚Äî with concerns over the impact of AI hitting a number of the big European players. Advertising groupWPPwas the sector's worst performer, slumping as it reported a71% pre-tax profit fallin the first half and cut its full-year outlook. For September and the year ahead, some market participants are positive. \"We believe the equity bull market will remain intact. In our base case, we expect an economic soft landing, solid corporate earnings, and lower interest rates to support markets over the next 12 months,\" Mark Haefele, chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note. Others are more cautious. EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco says the U.S. economy is \"showing resilience, but it's under increasing pressure. While the U.S. economy grew at a robust annualized rate of 3.0% in Q2 2025, the strength was largely a mirage, reflecting a sharp decline in imports after businesses accelerated purchases in response to tariffs earlier in the year.\" Looking ahead, a recent Barclays report predicted a slowdown in the second half, but a rebound in U.S. and European economic growth in 2026, saying \"markets will move on from reacting to the twin topics of tariffs and the U.S. tax bill.\" As market-makers and investors return from their summer holidays to rebalance their portfolios, there will be some key moments to watch out for, including: Monday: Labour Day (U.S. markets closed); EU unemployment Tuesday: EU inflation; U.S. manufacturing data Friday: EU GDP; U.S. non-farm payrolls Sept. 8: French no-confidence vote Sept. 11: ECB policy decision Sept. 16-17: Federal Reserve policy decision Sept. 17: President Trump makes state visit to U.K. Sept. 18: Bank of England policy decision",
